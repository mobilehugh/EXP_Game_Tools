. in the repo folder add the folder Records, and in Records add the folders Bin, Players, Referee and Toys
. python3 a_persona_record.py 

## How To Linux
linux now protects the integrated python3 from dangerous system wide pip installs

. sudo apt install python3.XX-venv (usu 3.12) if you don't have virual environments installed
. hit up .gitignore with a venv/
. go to folder where a_person_record.py is located
. source venv/bin/activate
. pip install fpdf2
. in the repo folder add the folder Records, and in Records add the folders Bin, Players, Referee and Toys
. python3 a_persona_record.py 
. at end type "deactivate" in terminal


.*Folders should look like*
* /Repo Folder 
** a_persona_record.py etc
** /Records
*** /Bin
*** /Players
*** /Referee
*** /Toys

best of luck and have fun
