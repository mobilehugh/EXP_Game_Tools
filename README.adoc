. go to folder where a_person_record.py is located
. python3 -m venv venv
. source venv/bin/activate
.. shell should have (venv) user@comp:
. pip install fpdf2
. add the folder Records, and in Records add the folders Bin, Players, Referee and Toys
.. mkdir -p Records/{Bin,Players,Referee,Toys}
. python3 a_persona_record.py
